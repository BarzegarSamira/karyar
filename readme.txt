Learning Git is crucial for effective version control in software development.
It allows you to track changes in your code over time, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.
This feature is particularly valuable when working on complex projects, as it helps manage different iterations of your code
while minimizing the risk of losing important work. Additionally, Git's branching capabilities enable you to develop new features
or fix bugs in isolation without affecting the main codebase, fostering experimentation and collaboration among team members.
